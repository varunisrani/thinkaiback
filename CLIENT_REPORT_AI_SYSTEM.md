# AI Script Analysis System for Film Production
## Executive Report for Film Producers

---

## 🎬 **What This AI System Does**

Our AI system automatically analyzes your film scripts and provides detailed production planning data. Think of it as having an experienced 1st AD (Assistant Director) who reads your entire script and gives you precise shooting schedules, budgets, and logistics - but in minutes instead of days.

---

## 🔄 **How the AI Agent Works**

### **Step 1: Script Upload**
- You upload your PDF script (like BLACK_PANTHER.pdf)
- The system reads every page, every line, every word

### **Step 2: Intelligent Scene Detection**
- AI identifies scene headers (INT. WAKANDA THRONE ROOM - DAY)
- Extracts location type (Interior/Exterior)
- Determines time of day (Day/Night/Dawn/Dusk)
- Finds location names (WAKANDA THRONE ROOM)

### **Step 3: Page-by-Page Analysis**
- Each page is divided into 8 "eighths" (industry standard)
- AI calculates shooting time for each eighth
- Analyzes content type (dialogue vs action)
- Determines complexity factors

### **Step 4: Production Planning**
- Calculates total shooting days needed
- Estimates crew size requirements
- Determines equipment complexity
- Provides detailed cost breakdowns

### **Step 5: Comprehensive Reports**
- Scene-by-scene breakdown
- Day-by-day shooting schedule recommendations
- Budget estimates
- Risk analysis
